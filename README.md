Sensor Projects
================================================

Projects for the summer internship in Parjana. Used python codes to gather data from different sensors, namely moisture sensor, humidity sensor, camera and current sensor. Configured the database parts in server, and stored the data both locally and remotely for furthur uses in water management field. Also wrote scripts to control the data collection processes.


Sensors
================================================
The current sensor is embeded within the Arduino UNO Board http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno. The rests are embedded in the Adafruit Raspberry Pi Board http://www.adafruit.com/categories/105. The detailed sensors information is as follows:
